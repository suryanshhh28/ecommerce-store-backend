# Ecommerce store backend🖥️
The ecommerce backend code is a robust and efficient solution developed using `Node.js and Express`, incorporating various technologies to ensure seamless functionality. The database architecture is designed with a combination of `Firebase` for authentication and `MongoDB` for storing all collections and data, providing a secure and scalable foundation for the ecommerce platform.🍀

Firebase is utilized for user authentication, ensuring a reliable and secure login process. MongoDB serves as the primary database, offering a flexible and scalable solution for storing diverse data collections related to products, orders, and other essential ecommerce entities. The use of `TypeScript` enhances the codebase by introducing static typing, making it more maintainable and reducing the likelihood of runtime errors.✒️

For payment processing, the integration of the `Stripe` payment gateway adds a secure and efficient means of handling transactions. This enables the ecommerce platform to provide a seamless and trustworthy payment experience for users.💸

To optimize data retrieval, the implementation includes `NodeCache` for caching. By storing frequently accessed data locally, the system significantly reduces the latency associated with fetching information from the database. This ensures a responsive user experience, with initial data fetch times exceeding 50ms and subsequent retrievals reduced to `less than 10ms` due to efficient local caching.🏪

The codebase follows the `REST architectural style`, offering a clear and standardized set of APIs and endpoints for communication between the frontend and backend. The use of the `MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern` enhances code organization, making it more modular and maintainable. This design choice promotes scalability and flexibility, allowing for easier feature additions and modifications.🌵

The application is structured as a `monolith`, simplifying deployment and maintenance. It is hosted on `render.com`, providing a reliable and scalable hosting platform. The deployment ensures that the APIs and endpoints are live, enabling seamless interaction with the ecommerce platform. Essential packages, such as `Multer` for image storage and CORS for preventing cross-origin issues, contribute to the overall robustness and security of the backend code.🐪
